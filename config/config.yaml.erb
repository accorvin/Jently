# The account that Jently will use for communicating with GitHub.
# You can either use standard login credentials, or you can
# specify a GitHub oauth token. If you choose to use an oauth token,
# make sure to comment out or delete the github_password from this file.
# Note that this config file supports ERB. This allows you to store
# sensitive information as shell environment variables which can then
# be referred to in this file.
# For example, if you were to store your GitHub login as the GITHUB_LOGIN
# environment variable, then you could specify your GitHub login like this:
# :github_login: <%= ENV['GITHUB_LOGIN'] %>
:github_login: github_login
:github_password: github_password
#:github_oauth_token: github_oauth_token

# To use Jently with GitHub Enterprise, you'll need to set the GitHub
# API and web endpoints. Otherwise, leave these lines commented out.
# Example api endpoint: https://GITHUB_URL/api/v3/
# Example web endpoing: https://GITHUB_URL
:github_api_endpoint: github_api_endpoint
:github_web_endpoint: github_web_endpoint

# The list of repositories to poll for pull requests and their corresponding
# job names in Jenkins. Entries should be in the form REPOSITORY_NAME=>JOB_NAME
# Note that repository names should be relative to the github web endpoint.
# Multiple repositories can be polled by separating the entries by a comma
:jobs: REPOSITORY_NAME=>JOB_NAME

# The interval between successive communications with GitHub.
# This makes sure we don't end up spamming GitHub's servers.
:github_polling_interval_seconds: 60

# If access to your Jenkins CI is restricted with a login and password,
# you can enther these here. Otherwise you should comment out or delete these lines.
:jenkins_login: jenins_login
:jenkins_password: jenkins_password

# The url that your Jenkins CI can be found at.
:jenkins_url: jenkins_url

# The amount of time Jently will wait for a test job to complete before marking it
# as timed out. A good number for this is twice the amount of time that the test job
# should take on average.
:jenkins_job_timeout_seconds: 1800

# The interval between successive polling requests that Jently makes to Jenkins in
# order to query the state of the test job.
